## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned more about CSS grid and how to use it. I also learned how to use the overlay on CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. I also learned how to use the form and how to validate it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.submit {
  width: 100%;
  height: 54px;
  border-radius: 50px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-left: -123px;
  width: 142px;
  background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(0, 80%, 86%), hsl(0, 74%, 74%));
  box-shadow: 2px 4px 14px hsla(0, 36%, 70%, 0.8);
  transition-duration: 0.3s;
  transition-property: transform, box-shadow;
  transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  color: white;
  font-weight: var(--fw-regular);
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on CSS grid and how to use it. I also want to learn more about advanced concepts of Javascript and CSS. I will continue practising and building projects to improve my skills.

### Useful resources

- [Color overlay on hover image ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40292168/color-overlay-on-hover-image) - This helped me to understand how to use the overlay on CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [How to validate forms in React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TPYxLVq0FY) - This is an amazing video tutorial which helped me finally understand how to validate forms in React. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
